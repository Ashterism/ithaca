      <h2>About Ithaca</h2>
      <p>At Ithaca, we offer two core services: <strong>Sustainability</strong> and <strong>Digital Delivery</strong>. They’re distinct in content — but <strong>connected by approach</strong>. Both are rooted in <strong>systems thinking</strong>, real-world requirements, and continuous improvement.</p>
      <p>Whether we’re shaping a climate strategy or building a digital solution, we start by understanding what’s actually needed — not what’s assumed. Then we iterate, improve, and deliver — always engaging the people that matter most.</p>
      <p>Because success — in either domain — comes down to the same thing: <strong>clarity, context, and creating something that works</strong>.</p>
