  <h2>About Ithaca</h2>
  <p>At Ithaca, we offer two core services: Sustainability and Digital Delivery. They’re distinct in content — but connected by approach. Both are rooted in systems thinking, real-world requirements, and continuous improvement.</p>
  <p>Whether we’re shaping a climate strategy or building a digital solution, we start by understanding what’s actually needed — not what’s assumed. Then we iterate, improve, and deliver — always engaging the people that matter most.</p>
  <p>Because success — in either domain — comes down to the same thing: Clarity, context, and creating something that works.</p>
